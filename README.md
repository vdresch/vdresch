## Data Scientist, Economist, Tinkerer ðŸ¤˜

With background in economics, I've learned to be data driven. Thats how I got into the world of R, Python, data scrappers and models.

That said, I love tampering with all sort of stuff. From a very amateur personal website, to beer fermenters and motorcycles, I will tear it apart to learn how it works, and find a way to improve it. ðŸ”§
